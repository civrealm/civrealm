# *CivRealm*: A Learning and Reasoning Odyssey in *Civilization* for Decision-Making Agents

CivRealm is an interactive environment for the open-source strategy game [Freeciv-web](https://github.com/freeciv/freeciv-web) based on [Freeciv](https://www.freeciv.org/), a Civilization-inspired game. Within CivRealm, we provide interfaces for two typical agent types: tensor-based reinforcement learning agents based on the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API, and language-based agents powered by language models.

We also provide a set of tools for training and evaluating agents, as well as a set of baselines for both agent types. We hope that CivRealm can serve as a testbed for developing and evaluating agents that can learn and reason in complex environments.
